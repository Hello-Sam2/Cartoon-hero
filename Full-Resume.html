	<p>
		My name is Samuel Beacher, I'm 15 years old and a sophmore at Elizabeth Irwin High School. I love to do Mixed Martial Arts and Tricking, a style of martial arts mixed with gymnastics. Formerly, I worked as a counselour for the martial arts camp at my studio. I am interested in many topics including pottery and have been playing piano for 8 years. I also read extensivley from authors like Rick Riordan to James Clavell.

	I have many non-academic interests including baking. Especially after the pandemic, I tried out baking items from bread, like challah, to cakes and other goods. I am in the instrumental jazz band at LREI and I am also interested in some visul arts including drawing.

	<p>
		Academically, I am very interested in the environment. In Eighth grade, the project I studied was on coral reefs and relationships between oceans and climate change. I plan on studying more about the environment and hope to study environmental science in college. I have been to many national parks and forests including Sequoia, the adiorondacks, the redwood forest and many others.
