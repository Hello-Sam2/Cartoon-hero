	<p>
		My name is Samuel Beacher, I'm 15 years old and a sophmore at Elizabeth Irwin High School. I love to do Mixed Martial Arts and Tricking, a style of martial arts mixed with gymnastics. Formerly, I worked as a counselour for the martial arts camp at my studio. I am interested in many topics including pottery and have been playing piano for 8 years.
