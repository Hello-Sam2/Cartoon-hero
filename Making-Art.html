		<p>Robert Beacher aka Mr. Beacher has been teaching in the NYC Public School System as an art teacher for over 20 years. He has taught at multiple schools in the past most notably Cunningham (I.S. 234), and the school he is at now, MSAP.</p>
		<p>Mr. Beacher is versed well in many forms of visual art including pottery, painting, sculpture, and many more. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, he had to adapt his lessons to distance learning. During this period he had to find his way through many challenges including not knowing the materials his students had, and the inability to teach them the lesson directly.</p>
		<p>So, he enlisted help in his son, Samuel Beacher, and started to create instructional videos. With Sam as the editor, he was able to create high quality art educational videos. </p>
